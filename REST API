Re presentational S tate T ransfer

- we transfer DATA instead of User Interfaces from someone elses server to our server
- a different kind of response is needed

4 Points we have to think about:
  • Endpoints
  • Paths
  • Parameters
  • Authentification

!- only the response and request data changes. NOT the general server-side logic!


DATA FORMATS we can exchange

HTML, Plain Text, XML, JSON

        HTTP Methods
                           
  POST Post a resource to the server -> Thats what we use actually everytime
  GET get a resource from the server

Clearly defined API Endpoints                 Topic: Authentication 
will clearly difined request +      Server and Client dont store any connection history
response data structure             , every request is handled seperately
